# w22_ensf409_group80_project
This project asked our group to design an application which will calculate the most efficient combination of inventory which can be used to create a hamper for a foodbank. 
For example, if a client needs food for three adult males and two children over 8, the application should be able to calculate the combination of items that will meet their nutritional needs for one week, with the least amount of surplus. 
Furthermore, it should be possible to request multiple hampers of differing configurations as part of a single request. 
The application should remain active and able to take new requests until a user chooses to exit the program.
Once a request for one or more hampers has been created, the application should generate an order form for the request, ordered by hamper, and remove the items from inventory. 
If it is not possible to fulfill a complete order, the application should not remove any items from inventory and should report on the shortages which caused the order not to be fulfilled. 
This will allow Example Food Bank to use financial resources to procure supplies with nutritional profiles which match the shortfall.
